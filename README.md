# [WIP] 2Checkout-API
https://www.2checkout.com/payment-api

With 2Checkoutâ€™s Payment API, buyers can place sales directly on your website, with no redirection to our checkout.
You can take credit card information with a simple HTML form, and use our 2co.js JavaScript library to convert the
credit card information into a secure token. The token can then be safely passed to your server so that you can submit
the transaction using our API.
